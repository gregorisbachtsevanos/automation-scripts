## How to Use:
Define Playlists: Modify the playlists dictionary with your desired songs categorized by mood or activity. Replace "Artist - Song" placeholders with actual song titles and artists.

Generate Playlists: Call the generate_playlist function with a mood/activity from your defined playlists. It will randomly shuffle and display the songs in that playlist category.

Expand and Customize: You can expand this script by adding more playlists, integrating with music APIs to fetch real-time data, or enhancing the selection logic based on additional parameters like user preferences or time of day.

This example provides a starting point. Depending on your specific needs, you can further enhance it with features like:

Integration with Music APIs: Fetching playlists dynamically from services like Spotify or Apple Music.
User Input: Allowing users to specify preferences such as genre, tempo, or specific artists.
Output Formats: Exporting playlists to text files, music player formats, or sharing them via email or social media.
