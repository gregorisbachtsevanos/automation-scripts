### Install Required Libraries
You will need smtplib, email, and schedule. The first two are part of Python's standard library, while schedule can be installed via pip.
```
pip install schedule
```

### Set Up Your Email Account
Ensure you have an email account to send emails from. You might need to enable "Less secure app access" if you are using a Gmail account or use an app-specific password.

## Explanation

### Email Configuration
Replace your_email@example.com and your_password with your email credentials.
Set the receiver_email to the recipient's email address.
Configure the SMTP server details (e.g., smtp.example.com). For Gmail, it would be smtp.gmail.com and port 587.

### Email Content
Customize the subject and body of the email as needed.

### Scheduling
The script uses the schedule library to send the email daily at 8 AM. You can change the time by modifying the schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(send_email) line.

### Running the Script
The while True loop keeps the script running, checking if it's time to send the email.
Running the Script
Save the script to a file, for example, daily_email_report.py.
Run the script using Python:
```
python daily_email_report.py
```
Ensure your machine is on and connected to the internet for the script to run and send emails as scheduled.

# Index.ts

## Install Node.js
Ensure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from nodejs.org.

## Create a New Project:
Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary packages.
```
mkdir daily-email-reporter
cd daily-email-reporter
npm init -y
npm install nodemailer node-schedule @types/node
```

## Explanation

### Email Configuration
Replace your_email@example.com and your_password with your email credentials.
Set the receiverEmail to the recipient's email address.
Configure the email service (e.g., gmail).

### Email Content
Customize the subject and text fields of the mailOptions object as needed.

### Scheduling
The script uses the node-schedule library to send the email daily at 8 AM. The cron-like expression '0 8 * * *' specifies this schedule.
### Running the Script:
Compile the TypeScript file to JavaScript and run it using Node.js.
```
tsc dailyEmailReporter.ts
node dailyEmailReporter.js
```

## Additional Steps

### TypeScript Configuration
Create a tsconfig.json file for TypeScript configuration if you haven't already:
```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES6",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
For better security, store sensitive information like email credentials in environment variables and access them in your script using process.env.
```
// Load environment variables
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const senderEmail = process.env.SENDER_EMAIL!;
const senderPassword = process.env.SENDER_PASSWORD!;
const receiverEmail = process.env.RECEIVER_EMAIL!;
```
Ensure you have a .env file in your project directory:
```
SENDER_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
SENDER_PASSWORD=your_password
RECEIVER_EMAIL=receiver_email@example.com
```
